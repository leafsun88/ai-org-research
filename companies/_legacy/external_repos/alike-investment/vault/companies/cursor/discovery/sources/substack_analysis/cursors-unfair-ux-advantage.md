Cursor's Unfair UX Advantage

Why a small unit of work creates a huge amount of trust

If you’ve followed our posts over the last few weeks, you know we’ve been obsessed with how agents generate and use data to build moats. When you get the right kind of data for your agent, you’re able to create a quality flywheel and stickiness that become hard to displace. In our posts on this topic, the example we keep returning to is Cursor.

What Cursor has done over the last three years is fascinating. They are competing head-on with frontier model labs that effectively have infinite capital, and somehow they’ve managed to compete effectively. While Cursor is now well-capitalized, it didn’t start that way. We keep asking ourselves: How did they build a data moat so powerful that they could eventually train a model — Composer — that they claim is faster and better at complex coding than generic LLMs?

There are many things that make a startup successful, and we shouldn’t underrate the effects of distribution and virality. But the thing that consistently captures our attention is UX. Cursor leveraged a familiar UX to create a data flywheel by mastering the unit of work that it was executing on. Whether this was an intentional stroke of genius or good luck paired with phenomenal execution, we may never know – but either way, it worked.

The Junior Employee Problem

To understand Cursor’s success, let’s start with a simpler example. Imagine you have a junior employee who is smart and hardworking – capability and effort are not an issue, but they’re simply a little inexperienced. (This is exactly how we’d describe most agents today.) When you give them a bigger task – perhaps something that requires 2 weeks of work – you don’t expect them to be fully autonomous in scoping, planning, and executing on that task.

If they unwittingly make a wrong assumption about requirements or scope somewhere along the way, they’re going to spend two weeks working hard – and return with a comprehensive finished result that might be totally useless. Unwinding this mistake is then a challenge all on its own. You have to understand what they misunderstood, figure out how to correct that assumption, and then restart the work to get the result you need. Not only is it time lost, the complexity of undoing the mistaken assumptions is higher than doing it yourself: In many cases, it might just be easier to do the work yourself rather than waiting for them to figure it out. That’s why junior employees usually require thoughtful guidance and mentorship.

Many agents have this quality today. We’ve all asked ChatGPT to research something, gone to get coffee, and returned five minutes later to find it completely missed the mark. It did a bunch of work, but it wasn’t the work we needed – so we ignore the results.

The problem in both these examples is the unit of work. Until you can fully trust an agent or an employee to scope, plan, and execute on a task independently – and some agents are certainly getting there – you need to reduce the scope of each incremental step. By reducing the scope, you can then make progress, stop for feedback, reorient, and continue on the right track. If a mistake is made, it’s caught and corrected early on.

The Autocomplete Advantage

Cursor created exactly the opposite experience of the wayward junior employee or a bad ChatGPT search. We forget now, but in the early days, Cursor was an LLM-powered autocomplete tool with a chat window on the side. Autocomplete is a low stakes interaction mode because the unit of work is extremely small and manageable. Cursor didn’t take on minutes or hours of work without getting feedback – it would just take the context of what you were writing and suggest an update. Almost every engineer was familiar with traditional tab-complete, so it was easy to hit tab if the suggestion was good or hit escape if it was bad.

The value in this UX was asymmetric. A bad suggestion cost you a few seconds to read and reject. A good suggestion saved you minutes of typing out the code that you would have written otherwise anyway – and if the suggestion was good, you often got cleaner and safer code than you would have written by hand. Even if the suggestions were only right 50% of the time, it was a massive time savings.

Once Cursor introduced automated code editing via prompts – what eventually became Cursor Agent – this small task UX remained a core part of their experience. Because the interface was an extension of the IDE and was initially scoped to one or a few code files, it encouraged making small incremental changes. At RunLLM, we explicitly advise new engineers to treat coding agents as incremental implementers rather than a fully autonomous agent that can be trusted with whole tasks. The engineer’s guidance and longer-term planning are still critical.

The result of this UX was that you weren’t asking Cursor to implement a whole feature from scratch – you had the plan in your head, and you guided Cursor step by step. If any one change was wrong, it was easy to undo and reorient. That created the trust and data flywheel that allowed Cursor to rapidly improve to the point of being trusted with much more autonomy today.

Cursor vs. Devin: Expectation Management

Contrast this with end-to-end coding agents like Devin. Over a year ago, we observed that Devin struggled because it was designed to complete a task end-to-end – the UX was that you would give Devin a Linear ticket or a Slack thread and have it implement that from scratch, and if you wanted, you could watch it plan along the way.

When you set the expectation of task completion, anything less than a 100% finished product feels like a failure – and we certainly felt like Devin was not able to match Cursor’s productivity gains because it wasn’t autonomous enough. Like a junior employee, it would run off and do too many things based on incorrect assumptions and struggle to reconcile the issues it created for itself. Cursor never set that expectation. By keeping the unit of work small, they convinced users to stay in the loop even before the agent was fully optimized.

Devin was trying to leverage trust that it was not able to earn or justify. On the other hand, Cursor built trust incrementally: Those “yes/no” clicks on small code blocks provided the high-density feedback that created their data moat.

Maximize Correctness

If you’re building an AI application, we think the golden question is how effectively you can find the minimal effective unit of work. Once it becomes quick and easy for your user to say “yes, good” or “no, do this differently” – without the frequency becoming annoying – you will gather significantly more useful data. You’re effectively gamifying the process of using your agent: How can the user give it the right input to maximize the chance that they get what they want? If your unit of work is a full feature or a whole slide deck, it’s not a very good game. If your unit of work is 10s of lines of code or an investigation hypothesis, you’re in much better shape. Small units of work also create more data, which deepens your moat.

Making the unit of work small has a powerful second-order benefit: Being right at some point is more important than never being wrong. That might sound counterintuitive. Aren’t all agents looking to maximize accuracy? Of course the answer is yes, but the question is how you measure accuracy. What users care about is whether they get the work done faster than they would have otherwise. If doing it manually takes 30 minutes, and three prompts get them there in 30 seconds, that’s still a win. It doesn’t matter that the first prompt didn’t solve the problem – cumulative multi-shot accuracy matters more than zero-shot accuracy.

As inference becomes cheaper, the value of every individual piece of work drops dramatically. You can now do lots of work, realize it was wrong, throw it away, and start over – and still be incredibly productive. From a product design perspective, that means you don’t need to have the perfect answer the first time around. Make sure that it’s quick and easy for your user to give you feedback and that your iteration loop is fast. If you get that loop right, you’re off to the races.

Cursor’s focus on building an AI-powered IDE gave it a massive UX head-start over the products racing to build end-to-end autonomous agents. By the time the autonomous crowd realized that trust is built in increments, Cursor already captured the market. For builders, the lesson is clear: Design your agent to work in small, high-feedback increments, and the data loop will take care of the rest.
