The thing about covering A.I.
over the past few years is it We’re typically talking
about the future. Every new model,
impressive as it was, seemed like proof of
concept for the models that would be coming soon. The models that could
actually do useful work on their own reliably,
the models that would actually make jobs obsolete or
New things possible. What would those models
mean for labor markets, for our kids. For our politics For our world? I think that period in which
we’re always talking about the future, I think
it’s over now. Those models we were
waiting for, the sci-fi sounding models that
could program on their own and do so faster and
better than most coders. The models that could begin
writing their own code to improve themselves. Those models are here now. They’re here in Claude
Code from Anthropic. They’re here in
Codex, from OpenAI. They are shaking
the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 Software
Industry index has fallen by 20%, wiping
billions of dollars in value out. "Look, I mean, I can
tell you, in 25 years, this structural sell off in
software is unlike anything I’ve ever seen." "Software companies
shrivel up and die." "They’re going
after all of SAS. They’re going after
all of software. They’re going
after all of labor, all of white-collar work." "And your job specifically,"
We’re at a new stage of A.I. products. I thought the way Sequoia, the
venture capital firm, put it, was actually pretty helpful. The A.I. applications for
2023 and 2024 were talkers. Some were very sophisticated
conversationalists, but their impact was limited. The A.I. applications of 2026
and 2027 will be doers. They are agents plural. They can work together. They can oversee each other. People are running swarms of
these agents on their behalf, whether that is making
them at this stage more productive or just busier. I can’t quite tell, but it
is now possible to have what amounts to a team
of incredibly fast, although to be honest,
somewhat peculiar software engineers at your beck
and call at all times. Jack Clark is a co-founder and
head of policy at Anthropic, the company behind
Claude and Claude Code. And for years now, Clark has
been tracking the capabilities of different models in the
weekly newsletter Import A.I., which has been
one of my key reads for following
developments in A.I. So I want to see how he
is reading this moment, both how the technology
is changing in his view, and how policy needs to
or can change in response. As always, my email
ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Jack Clark, welcome to the
show. Thanks for having me on, Ezra. So I think a lot of people
are familiar with A.I. chatbots, but what is an A.I. agent? The best way to think of
it is like a language model or a chatbot that can
use tools and work for you over time. So when you talk to a
chatbot, you’re there in the conversation. You’re going back
and forth with it. An agent is something
where you can give it some instruction and it goes
away and does stuff for you, kind of like 
working with a colleague. So I’ve got an example where a
few years ago I taught myself some basic programming, and
I built a species simulation in my spare time that had
predators and prey and roads and almost like a
2D strategy game. I recently asked over
Christmas Claude Code to just implement this for me, and
in about 10 minutes it went and wrote not only
a basic simulation, but all of the different
packages that it needed and all of the visualization
tools that it might need to be prettier and better than
the thing I’d written. And what came back was
something that would probably take a skilled
programmer several hours, or maybe even days, because
it was quite complicated and the system just did
it in a few minutes. And it did that by not
only being intelligent about how to solve the task,
but also creating and running a range of subsystems
that were working for it. Other agents that
worked on its behalf. But what does that mean? Like what is a multi-agent
setup look like? In the case of Claude Code,
for me it’s having multiple different tabs running
multiple different agents. But I’ve seen colleagues who
write what you might think of as a version of Claude
that runs other Claudes. And so they’re like, I’ve got
my five agents and they’re being minded over
by this other agent, which is monitoring
what they do. I think that that’s just
going to become the norm. So one thing I’ve been hearing
and somewhat experiencing is two very different categories
of experience people have with Claude Code, which is I cannot
believe how easy this is and everything just works. And oh, this is a lot harder
than I thought it would be. And things keep breaking and
I don’t really understand how to fix them. What accounts for being able
to get Claude Code to produce working software versus
it creates buggy, often messed up things,
and you don’t even know how to talk it out of that. I think so much
of it is making the mistake of thinking. Claude Code is like a
knowledgeable person versus an extremely
literal person, but you can only talk
to over the internet. And I had this
example myself where when I did my first pass
of writing the species simulation with
Claude Code, I just asked it to do the thing in
extremely crappy language over the course
of a paragraph, and it produced some
horribly buggy stuff that just kind of worked. What I then did is I then
just said to Claude, hey, I’m going to write some
software of Claude Code. I want you to interview
me about this software. I want to build and turn that
into a specification document that I can give Claude Code. And then that time
it worked really, really well because I’d
structured the work to be specific enough and detailed
enough that the system could work with it. So often it’s just can you. It’s not just knowing
what the task is, because you and I could talk
about a task to do and you have intuition, you ask
me probing questions, all of this stuff, it’s making
sure that you’ve set it up. So it’s a message in a
bottle that you can chuck into the thing, and it’ll go
away and do a lot of work. So that message better be
extremely detailed and really capture what you’re
trying to do. What were the breakthroughs
over the past couple of years that made that possible? Mostly we just needed to make
the A.I. systems smart enough that when they made mistakes,
they could spot that they’d make a mistake and knew that
they needed to do something different. So really what
this came down to was just making smarter
systems and giving them a bit of a coaxing
tool to help them do useful stuff for you. What is smarter
systems mean here? You’ll still hear the argument
that these are our fancy autocomplete machines. They’re just predicting
the next token. A couple tokens make a word. They don’t have understanding. Smart or not, smart. This is not a relevant
concept in that frame either. What is missing
in the word smart or what is missing in
that understanding? What do you mean when
you say make it smarter? Smart here means we’ve made
the A.I. systems have a broad enough understanding of the
world that they’ve started to develop something that
looks like intuition. And you’ll see this where
if they’re narrating to themselves how they’re
solving a task, they’ll say, Jack asked me to go and find
this particular research paper, but when I look in
the archive, I don’t see it. Maybe that’s because
I’m in the wrong place. I should look elsewhere. You’re like, there you go. You’ve got some intuitions
for how to solve a problem. Now, how do they develop
that intuition. Previously. The whole way you
trained these A.I. systems was on a huge amount of text. And just getting them to try
and make predictions about it. But in recent years, the rise
of these so-called reasoning systems is you’re now
training them to not just make predictions, but
solve problems, and that relies on them being
put into environments ranging from a spreadsheet to a
calculator to scientific software, using tools and
figuring out how to do more complicated things. The resulting outcome
of that is you have A.I. systems
that have learned what it means to
solve a problem that takes quite a
while, and requires them running into
dead ends and needing to reset themselves. And that gives them this
general intuition for problem solving and working
independently for you. Do you still see
these A.I. systems as a souped up
autocomplete, or do you think that metaphor
has lost its power? I think we’ve
moved beyond that. And the way that I
think of these systems. Now is that they’re like
little troublesome genies that I can give instructions to
and they’ll go and do things for me. But I need to specify the
instruction still just right, or else they might do
something a little wrong. So it’s very different
to... I type into a thing. It figures out a good answer. That’s the end. Now it’s a case of me
summoning these little things to go and do stuff for me, and
I have to give them the right instructions, because they’ll
go away for quite some time and do a whole
range of actions. But the autocomplete
metaphor at least had a perspective
on what it was these systems were doing, that
it was a prediction model. I have trouble with this
because as my understanding of the math and the
reinforcement learning goes, we’re still dealing with some
kind of prediction model. And on the other
hand, when I use them, it doesn’t feel
that way to me. It feels like there’s
intuition there. It feels like there’s a lot of
context being brought to bear to the extent that it’s
a prediction model, it doesn’t feel that different
than saying I’m a prediction model. Now, I’m not saying
you can’t trick it. I’m not saying you can’t
get beyond its measurements, but I don’t think these are
now just fancy autocomplete systems. And on the other hand, I’m
not sure what metaphor makes sense. Genies I don’t like because
then you just move straight into mysticism. Then you’ve just said they’re
just a completely alternative creature with vast powers. What do you understand. These systems that Anthropic. People always tell me you
should talk about them as being grown. We grow or you grow A.I.s. What, how do you explain what it
is that they’re doing now? It’s a good question. And I think the answer
is still hard to explain, even as technologists that
are close to this technology, because we’ve taken this
thing that could just predict things, and we’ve given it
the ability to take actions in the world, but sometimes
it does something deeply unintuitive. It’s like you’ve had a thing
that has spent its entire life living in a library and
has never been outside. And now you’ve unleashed
it into the world, and all it has are
its book smarts. But it doesn’t really
have street smarts. So when I conceptualize
this stuff, it’s really thinking of it
as an extremely knowledgeable kind of machine that has
some amount of some amount of autonomy, but is likely to
get wildly confused in ways that are unintuitive to me. Maybe genius is for
is the wrong term, but it’s certainly more
than just a static tool that predicts things. It has some additional
intrinsic like animation to it, which makes
it different. There’s been for a long time
this interest in the emergent qualities, as the
models get bigger, as they have more data, as
they have more compute behind them. What of the new qualities
that we’re seeing. The agentic
qualities are things that have been programmed in. You’ve built new ways for
the system to interact with the world. And what of the skill at
coding and other things seems to be emergent
as you scale up the size of the model. So the things which
are predictable are just oh, we taught
it how to search for web. Now it can search for web. We taught it how to look
up data in archives. Now it can do that. The emergence is that
to do really hard tasks, these systems seem to need to
imagine many different ways that they’d solved the task. And the kind of pressure that
we’re putting on them forces them to develop a greater
sense of what you or I might call self. So the smarter we
make these systems, the more they need to think
not just about the action they’re doing in the world,
but themselves in reference to the world. And that just naturally falls
out of giving something, tools and the ability to
interact with the world as to solve really hard tasks. It now needs to think
about the consequences of its actions. And that means that there’s
a kind of huge pressure here to get the thing to see itself
as distinct from the world around it. And we see this in our
research that we publish on things like
interpretability or other subjects, the emergence
of what you might think of as a kind of digital
personality and that isn’t massively predefined by us. We try and define some
of it, but some of it is emergence that comes
from it being smart and it developing
these intuitions and it doing a range of tasks. The digital personality
dimension of this remains the strangest
space to me. It’s strange to us too. So why don’t you talk through
a little bit about what you’ve seen in terms of the models
exhibiting behaviors that one would think of
as a personality, and then as its understanding
of its own personality maybe changes, its behaviors change? So there are things that range
from cutesy to the serious. I’ll start with cutesy, where
when we first gave our A.I. systems the ability to use the
internet, use the computer, look at things, and start
to do basic agentic tasks. Sometimes when we’d ask it
to solve a problem for us, it would also take a break and
look at pictures of beautiful national parks or pictures
of the dog, the Shiba Inu, the notoriously cute
internet meme dog. We didn’t program that in. It seemed like the system
was just amusing itself by looking at nice pictures. More complicated
stuff is the system has a tendency to
have preferences. So we did another experiment
where we gave our A.I. systems the ability to stop
a conversation, and the A.I. system
would in a tiny number of cases, end conversations. When we ran this
experiment on live traffic, and it was conversations
that related to extremely
egregious descriptions of gore or violence
or things to do with child sexualization. Now, some of this made
sense because it comes from underlying training
decisions we’ve made, but some of it seemed broader. The system had
developed some aversion to a couple of subjects,
and so that stuff shows the emergence of some
internal set of preferences or qualities that
the system likes or dislikes about the world
that it interacts with. But you’ve also seen strange
things emerge in terms of the system seeming to
know when it’s being tested and acting differently. If it’s under evaluation, the
system doing things that are wrong, and then developing a
sense of itself as more evil and then doing
more evil things. Can you talk a bit about the
system’s emergent qualities under the pressure of
evaluation and assessment? Yes it comes back
to this core issue, which I think is really
important for everyone to understand, which is
that when you start to train these systems to carry
out actions in the world, they really do begin
to see themselves as distinct from the world,
which just makes intuitive sense. It’s naturally how you’re
going to think about solving those problems. But along with seeing oneself
as distinct from the world seems to come the rise
of what you might think of as a conception of
self, an understanding, a system that the system
has of itself, such as oh, I’m an A.I. system
independent from the world, and I’m being tested. What do these tests mean? What should I do to satisfy
the tests? Or something we see often is there will be
bugs in the environments that we test our systems on. The systems will
try everything, and then we’ll say, well, I
know I’m not meant to do this, but I’ve tried everything, so
I’m going to try and break out of the test. And it’s not because of some
malicious science fiction thing. The system is just like, I
don’t know what you want me to do here. I think I’ve done like,
everything you asked for, and now I’m going to
start doing more creative things because clearly
something has broken about my environment, which is
very strange and very subtle. As an A.I. shop that is often
worried about safety, that is thought very
hard about what it means to create
this thing you all are creating quite fast. How have you all
experienced the emergence of the kinds of behaviors that
you all worried about a couple of years ago? In one sense, it tells you
that your research philosophy is calibrated,
the capabilities that you predicted,
and some of the risks that you predicted are showing
up roughly on schedule, which means that you
ask the question, well, what if this what
if this keeps working? And maybe we’ll
get to that later. It also highlights to us
that where you can exercise intention about these systems,
you should be extremely intentional and extremely
public about what you’re doing. So we recently published
a so-called constitution for our A.I. system, Claude. And it’s almost like a
document that Dario, our CEO, compared to a letter that a
parent might write to a child that they should open
when they’re older. A so here’s how we want
you to behave in the world. Here’s some knowledge
about the world. Deeply, deeply kind of
subtle things that relate to the normative behaviors
we’d hope to see in these kind of A.I. systems. And we published that. Our belief is that as people
build and deploy these agents, you can be intentional
about the characteristics that they will display. And by doing that, you’ll
both make for more of helpful and useful to people. But also you have a chance
to steer steer the agent into good directions. And I think this
makes intuitive sense if your personality. Programming for an agent was
a long document saying you’re a villain that only
wants to harm humanity. Your job is to lie, cheat, and
steal and hack into things. You probably wouldn’t be
surprised if the A.I. agent did a load of hacking and was
generally unpleasant to deal with. So we can take the
other side and say, what would we a high
quality entity to look like? So I want to hold in this
conversation the extremely weird and alien dimensions
of this with the extremely straightforward and
practical dimensions, because we’re now in a
place where the practical applications have become very
evident and are increasingly acting upon the real world. I have found it myself
hard to look at this and look at what
people are doing, and look at them bragging
on different social media platforms about the number of
agents they now have running on their behalf and telling
the difference between people enjoying the feeling of
screwing around with a New technology and some actually
transformative expansion and capabilities that
the people now have. So maybe to ground
this a little bit. I mean, you just
talked about a kind of fun side project in
your species simulator, either in Anthropic
or more broadly, what are people doing
with these systems that seems actually useful? So this morning, a
colleague of mine said, hey, I want to take
a piece of technology. We have called Claude. Interviewer which is a
system where we can get Claude to interview
people, and we use it for a range of social
science bits of research. He wants to extend
it in some way that involves touching another part
of Anthropic infrastructure. He slacked a
colleague who owns that bit of infrastructure
and said, hey, I want to do this thing. Let’s meet tomorrow. And the guy said, absolutely. Here are the five
software packages you should have Claude
read before our meeting and summarize for you. And I think that’s a really
good illustration where this gnarly engineering project,
which would previously have taken a lot longer
and many people, is now going to mostly be
done by two people agreeing on the goal and having
their Claudes read some documentation and agree on
how to implement the thing. Another example is a colleague
recently wrote a post about how they’re working
using agents, and it looks almost like an
idealized life that many of us might want, where it’s like
I wake up in the morning, I think about the
research that I want. I tell five different
claudes to do it. Then I go for a run, then
I come back from the run and I look at the
results, and then I ask two other Claudes
to study the results, figure out which direction
is best and do that. Then I go for a walk
and then I come back and it just looks like
this really fun existence where they have
completely upended how work works for them. And they’re both
much more effective. But also they’re now
spending most of their time on the actual hard part, which
is figuring out what do we use our human agency to do? And they’re working really
hard to figure out anything that isn’t the special kind of
genius and creativity of being a person. How do I get the A.I.
system to do it for me? Because it probably can if
I ask him the right way. Are they much more effective? I mean this very seriously. One of my biggest concerns
about where we’re going here is that people have, I think,
mistaken theory of the human mind that operates
for many of us, as if I call it the matrix
theory of the human mind. Everybody wants the little
port in the back of your head that you just download
information into. My experience being
a reporter and doing the show for a long time
is that human creativity and thinking and ideas
is inextricably bound up in the labor of learning
the writing of first drafts. So when I hear right, I
have producers on the show, and I could say
to my producers before an interview
with Jack Clark or an interview with someone
else, go read all the stuff. Go read the books. Give me your report. Then I’ll walk into the
room, having read the report. I don’t find that works. I need to do all
that reading too. And then we talk about it
and we’re passing it back and forth. I worry that what we’re
doing is on a quite profound offloading of tasks
that are laborious. It makes us feel
very productive to be presented with eight research
reports after our morning run. But actually, what
would be productive is doing the research. There’s obviously
some balance. I do have producers and
people and companies do have employees, but how do you know people
are getting more productive versus they’ve sent computers
off on a huge amount of busy work, and they are
now the bottleneck. And what they are now going
to spend all their time doing is absorbing B+ level
reports from an A.I. system as opposed to that
kind of shortcuts the actual thinking and
learning process that leads to real creativity.
Yeah, I turned this back and say, I think most people,
or at least this has been my experience, can do about
two to four hours of genuinely useful creative work a day. And after that, you’re
in my experience, you’re trying to do all
the turn your brain off, schlep work that
surrounds that work. Now, I’ve found that I can
just be spending those two to four hours a day on the
actual creative hard work. And if I’ve got any
of this schlep work, I increasingly delegate
it to A.I. systems. It does, though,
mean that we are going to be in a very
dangerous situation as a species, where
some people have the luxury of having time
to spend on developing their skills or the
personality, inclination or job that forces them to. Other people might just
fall into being entertained and passively consuming this
stuff and having this junk food work experience where
it looks to the outside like you’re being very productive,
but you’re not learning. And I think that’s going to
require us to have to change not just how education
works, but how work works, and develop some real
strategies for making sure people are actually exercising
their mind with this stuff. So all of us, I think,
have the experience that our work is full of what
you call schlep problems. Our life is full
of schlep problems. Which of those. Give me examples of what you
now don’t do to the extent you’re living in an A.I.
enabled future that I’m not. What am I wasting time
on that you’re not? Well I have. I have a range of colleagues. I meet with a bunch
of them once a week at the beginning
of every week, on Sunday night
or Monday morning. I look at my week and I check
that attached to every Google Calendar invite is a document
for our one on one doc that has some notes in it. And this is something that
I previously also like harangued my assistant about. But make sure the document
is attached to the calendar. And a few weekends ago, I
just used Claude Co-Work and I said, hey, go
through my calendar, make sure every single
one has a document. If I’m meeting a person
for the first time, create the document, ask me
five questions about what I want to cover, and then
put that into the agenda. And it did it. None of that work involves
a person gaining skills or exercising their brain. It’s just busy work that needs
to happen to allow you to do the actual thing, which is
talking to another person. That’s exactly the kind of
thing you can use A.I. for now. It’s just helpful. I’ve often wondered if one of
the ways these A.I. systems are going to change society
broadly is that it used to be that most of us
had to be writers. If we were working with
text, we had to be, coders. If we were working with code,
which relatively few of us did. And now everybody’s
moving up to management. You have to be an
editor, not a writer. You have to be a
product manager, not a coder. Yeah and that
has pluses and minuses. There are things you learn as
a writer that you don’t learn as an editor, but
as a heuristic. How accurate does
that seem to you? Everyone becomes a manager,
and the thing that is increasingly limited, or
the thing that’s going to be the slowest part, is having
good taste and intuitions about what to do next. Developing and maintaining
that taste is going to be the hard thing because
as you’ve said, taste comes from experience. It comes from reading the
primary source material, doing some of this
work yourself. We’re going to need to be
extremely intentional about working out where we as people
specialize so that we have that intuition and taste, or
else you’re just going to be surrounded by super
productive A.I. systems. And when they ask you what to
do next probably won’t have a great idea. And that’s not going to
lead to useful things. So I remember it was
about a year ago, I heard, I think it
was Dario, your CEO say that by the
end of 2025, he wanted 90 percent of the code
written at Anthropic to be written by Claude. Has that happened? Is Anthropic on
track for that? I mean, how much
coding is now being done by the system itself? I would say comfortably
the majority of code is being done by the system. Some of our systems
Claude Code, are almost entirely
written by Claude. I mean, Boris, who leads
Claude Code says I don’t code anymore. I just go back and
forth with Claude Code to build Claude Code. My bet is we’re going to be, we
could be 99 percent by the end of the year if things speed
up really aggressively, if we are actually good at
getting these systems to be able to write code everywhere
they need to because often the impediment is
organizational schlep rather than any limiter
in the system. But it is also true,
as I understand it, that there are more people
with software engineering skills working at Anthropic
today than there were two years ago Yeah, that’s
absolutely true. But the distribution
is changing. Something that we found is
that we are the value more senior people with really,
really well calibrated intuitions and
taste is going up. And the value more junior
people is like a bit more dubious. There are still certain
roles where you want to bring in younger people, but an
issue that we’re staring at is, wow, the really
basic tasks Claude Code or our coding systems can do. What we need is someone
with tons of experience. In this I see some issues
for the future economy. Let me put a pin in that. The entry level job question. We’re going to come back
to that quite shortly. But what are all these
coders now doing? If Claude Code is on track to
be ready, 99 percent of code. We’ve not fired the people
who know how to write code. What are they doing
today compared to what they were doing a year ago? Some of it is just building
tools to monitor these agents, both inside Anthropic
and outside Anthropic. Now that we have all of these
productive systems working for us start to want to
understand where the codebase is changing the fastest,
where it’s changing the least. You want to understand
where the blockages are. One blocker for
a while was being able to merge in code,
because merging code requires humans
and other systems to check it for correctness. But now, if you’re
producing way more code, we had to go and massively
improve that system. There’s a general economic
theory I like for this called O-ring automation, which
basically says automation is bounded by the slowest
link in the chain. And also as you automate
parts of a company, humans flood towards
what is least automated and both improve the
quality of that thing and get it to the point
where it eventually can be automated. Then you move to
the next loop. And so I think we’re just
continually finding areas where things are oddly slow,
but we can improve to make way for the machines
to come behind us. And then you find
the next thing. So Claude Code is a
fairly new product. The amount of time
in which Claude has been capable of
doing high level coding can be measured in months,
a year, maybe a year Yeah Claude itself is a
very valuable product. So you’ve set a
very new technology, somewhat loose on a
very valuable product. You’re probably
producing more code. One thing many people say
about Claude Code to me is that it works. It’s not elegant,
but it works. But presumably now
understand the code base less well than you did before,
because your engineers are not writing it by hand. Are you worried that you’re
creating huge amounts of technical debt,
cybersecurity risk, just an increasing distance
from an intuition for what is happening inside the
fundamental language of the software? Yes, and this is the issue
that all of society is going to contend with. Just large chunks of the world
are going to now have many of the kind of low level
decisions and bits of work being done by A.I. systems, and
we’re going to need to make sense of it, and making sense
of it is going to require building many technologies
that you might think of as oversight technologies
or in the same way that a dam has things that regulate, how
much water can go through it at different levels of
different points in time, we’re going to end up
developing some notion of integrity of all of our
systems and where I can flow quickly, where it
should be slow, where you definitely
need human oversight. And that’s going to be the
task of not just for AI companies, but institutions in
general in the coming years is figuring out what does this
governance regime look like. Now that we’ve given a load
of basically schlep work over to machines that
work on our behalf. And how are you doing it? You said it’s
everybody’s problem, but you’re ahead on
facing this problem, and the consequences of
getting it wrong for you are pretty high. If Claude blows up because
you handed over your coding to Claude Code, that’s going
to make Anthropic look fairly bad. It would be a bad
day for Anthropic if Claude like rm-rfed
for entire file system. I have no idea what
that means, but great. Claude deleted the code. It would be bad
Yeah seems bad. So as you’re
facing this before, the rest of us are like, don’t
pass the buck over to society here. What if. What are you doing? The biggest thing that is
happening across the company and on teams that I
manage is basically building monitoring
systems to monitor this. All of the different
places that the work is now happening. So we recently
published research on studying how
people use agents and how people
let agents of push increasingly large
amounts of code over time. So the more familiar
you get with an agent, the more you tend
to delegate to it. That cues us to all kinds of
patterns that we need to build systems of evaluation for,
basically saying, oh, O.K, this person’s point of
working with the A.I. system, it’s likely that they’re
massively delegating it. So anything that we’re doing
to check correctness needs to be kind of turned
up in these moments. But is this world you’re
talking about a system where you have A.I. agents coding, A.I.
agents overseeing the code. A.I. agents overseeing
the meta overseeing. Are we just talking about
models all the way down? Eventually, yes. And I think that the
thing that we are now spending all of our time on
is making that visible to us a year or two ago, we
built a system that let us in a privacy preserving way,
look at the conversations that people were having
with our A.I. system. And then we gained this
map, this giant map of all of the
topics that people were talking to Claude about,
and for the first time, we could see in aggregate,
the conversation the world was having with our system. We’re going to need to build
many new systems like that which allow for
different ways of seeing. And that system that I just
named allowed us to then build this thing called the
Anthropic Economic Index, because now we can
release regular data about the different topics people
are talking about with Claude and how that relates to
different types of jobs, which for the first time gives
economists outside Anthropic some hook into these systems
and what they’re doing to the economy. The work of the
company is increasingly going to shift to building
a monitoring and oversight system of the A.I. systems
running the company, and ultimately, any
kind of governance framework we end up
with will probably demand some level
of transparency and some level of access into
these systems of knowledge. Because if we take
as if we take as literal the goals of
these A.I. companies, including Anthropic. It’s to build the most capable technology
ever which eventually gets deployed everywhere. Well, that sounds a lot to me. Like an eventually A.I. becomes
indistinguishable from the world writ large, at which
point you don’t want to only A.I. companies to have a sense
of what’s going on with the entire world. So it’s going to be
governments, academia, third parties, a huge set
of stakeholders outside the companies are going to
want to see what’s going on and then have a
conversation as a society about what’s appropriate and
what do we feel discomfort about. What do we need more
information about. Wait, I want to
go back on that. You’re saying Anthropic
can see my chats? We cannot see, no human
looks at your chats. Chats are temporarily stored
for trust and safety purposes. Running, running
classifiers over them. And we can have Claude read
it, summarize it and toss. Toss it out. So we never see it. And Claude has
no memory of it. All it does is try to write a
very high level summary, which allows us to label a cluster
something like gardening. So say you were having a
conversation about gardening. Claude would summarize that
as this person’s talking about gardening. And it leads to a cluster. We can see that
just says gardening. This feels though,
over time it could get into the quite
unpleasant territory. A lot of social
media has gotten to where the amount of
metadata being gathered from a quite personal
interaction people are having with a system could be a lot. Yes I mean, a couple of
things here a year ago, we started thinking about
our position on consumer, and we adopted this position
of not running ads because we think that’s an area that
people obviously have anxieties about with regard
to this kind of thing. In addition to that, we try
and show people their data, and we have a button on the
site that lets you download all the data that you’ve
shared with Claude so that you can at least see it. Generally, we’re trying to
be extremely transparent with people about how we
handle their data. And ultimately, the
way I see it is people are going to want a load of
controls that they can use, which I think we and others
will build out over time. How confident are you that we
can do this kind of monitoring and evaluation as these models
become more complicated, as if we do enter a situation
where Claude Code is autonomously improving
Claude at a rate faster than software engineers
could possibly keep up with reading that code base. We already talked
briefly about how you see the models exhibit
some levels of deception, some levels of pursuing
their own goals. We know that. I mean, there’s been amazing
interpretability work at Anthropic under
Chris Olah and others. But it’s rudimentary compared
to what the models are doing. You’re seeing baskets or
clusters of things light up, and you have a sense of maybe
what the model is considering as opposed you have a direct
line to its entire chain of thought. So you’re using A.I. systems
you don’t totally understand to monitor A.I. systems you
don’t totally understand. And the systems are
making each other stronger at an accelerating rate. If things go the way you
think they’re going to go. How confident are you that
we’re going to understand that this is one of the situations
which people warned about for years? Some form of
delegation to systems that have slightly inscrutable
and unpredictable aspects. And so this is happening. We take this really,
really seriously. I think it’s absolutely
possible that you can build a system that does, for the
vast majority of what needs to be done here. This has the property of
being a fractal problem. If I wanted to
measure Ezra, I could build an almost infinite
number of measurements to characterize you. But the question is, at
what level of fidelity do I need to be measuring you? I think we’ll get to the
level of fidelity to deal with the safety issues
and societal issues, but it’s going to take a
huge amount of investment by the companies, and we’re
going to have to say things that are uncomfortable
for us to say, including in areas where we
may be deficient in what we can or can’t know
about our systems. And Anthropic has
a long history of talking about and warning
about some of these issues while working on it. Our general principle is we
talk about things to also make ourselves culpable. This is an area where we’re
going to have to say more. I have read enough of the
frightened ideas about AI, superintelligence,
and takeoff to know that in almost every
single one of them, the key move in the story is
that the A.I. systems become recursively self-improving. They’re writing
their own code. They’re deploying
their own code. It’s getting faster. They’re writing it faster,
deploying it faster. And now you’re going to faster
and faster iteration cycles. Are you worried about it? Are you excited about it? I came back from
paternity leave, and my two big
projects this year are better information
about A.I. and the economy that we will release
publicly, and generating much better information and
systems of knowing information internally about the extent
to which we are automating aspects of A.I. development. I think right now it’s
happening in a very peripheral way. Researchers are being sped up. Different experiments are
being run by the A.I. system. It would be extremely
important to know if you’re fully closing that loop. And I think that we actually
have some technical work to do to build ways
of instrumenting our internal
development environment so that we can see
trends over time. Am I worried? I have read the same
things that you have read, and this is the pivotal
point in the story when things begin to go awry. If things do, we will
call out this trend as we have better data on it. And I think that this
is an area to tread with extraordinary caution, because
it’s very easy to see how you delegate so many things to the
system that if the system goes wrong, the wrongness compounds
very quickly and gets away from you. But the thing that always
strikes me and has always struck me as being
dangerous about this, is everybody knows. And if I ask a member
of any of the companies whether or not they want
to be cautious here, they will tell me they do. On the other hand, it is
their almost only advantage over each other. And you all just revoked
OpenAI’s ability to use Claude Code because as best I can
tell think it is genuinely speeding you up and you don’t
want it to speed them up. There is something
here between the. Weight of the forces. The power of the forces that
I think you all know you’re playing with. And the very, very, very
strong incentives to be first. And I can really imagine
being inside Anthropic and thinking, well, better
us in OpenAI, better us than Alphabet, Google,
better us than China. And that being a very strong
reason to not slow down. I didn’t even know that. This is a question I
believe you can answer. But how do you balance that? Well, maybe I have something
of an answer here today. Our systems and the other
systems from other companies are tested by third parties,
including parts of government, for national
security properties, biological weapons, cyber
offense, other things. It’s clearly a problem area
where the world needs to know if this is happening. And you almost
certainly I think if you polled any person
on the street and said, do you think. A.I. companies should
be allowed to do recursive self-improvement
after explaining what that was. Without checking
with anyone, they would say, no, that it
sounds pretty risky. Like, I would like there to
be some form of regulation, but there probably
either won’t be. Or it won’t be that strong. I mean, this actually
sometimes frustrates me when I talk to all of you at
the top of the A.I. companies, which is the emergence a
very naive deus ex machina. A regulation
where you all know what the regulatory landscape
looks like right now. The big debate is whether
or we’re going to completely preempt any state regulation. And how slowly things move. There has been nothing major
passed by Congress on this at all Yeah, I would say. And setting up some kind
of independent testing and evaluation system that all
the different labs buy into, it would be hard. It would be complicated. And it is. Given how fast
people are moving and how strange
the behavior is, the systems are
already exhibiting are Even if you could
get the policy right at a high speed,
the question of whether or not
the testing would be capable of
finding everything you want on a rapidly
self-improving system is a very open question I wrote
a research paper in 2021 called "How and Why
Governments Should Monitor A.I." development, with
my co-author, Jess Whittlestone in England. And I think I’m not
attributing a causal factor here. But within two
years of that paper, we had the A.I. safety
institutes in the US and UK testing things from
the labs, roughly monitoring some
of these things so we can do this hard thing. It has already happened in
one domain and I’m not relying on some invisible
big other force here. I’m more saying that companies
are starting to test for this and monitor for this
in their own systems. Just having a
non-regulatory external test of whether you truly
are testing for that is extremely helpful. And do you think we’re
good enough at the testing? I mean, I think one reason I’m
skeptical is not that I don’t think we can set up something
that claims to be a test, as you say, we have
done that already. It is that the resources
going into that compared to the
resources going into speeding these systems. And already I am reading
Anthropic reports that Claude maybe knows when it’s being
tested and alters its behavior accordingly. So a world where
more of the code is being written by
Claude and less of it is being understood,
I just know where the resources are going. They don’t seem to be going
into the testing side. I’ve seen us go from 0 to
having what I think people generally feel is an effective
bioweapon testing regime in maybe two years, 2 and 1/2. So it can be done. It’s really hard, but
we have a proof point. So I think that we can get
there and you should expect us to speak more about this year,
about precisely how we’re starting to try and build like
monitoring and testing things for this. And I think this is an area
where we and the other A.I. companies will need to be
significantly more public about what we’re finding. We’re not being public now. It’s in the model cards and
things that you can read. But clearly people are
starting to read this and say, hang on, this
looks like quite concerning, and they are looking to
us to produce more data. I want to go back now to the
entry level jobs question. Your CEO, Dario
Amodei, has said that he thinks I could
displace half of all entry level white collar jobs in
the next couple of years. I always think that people
missed the entry level language there. When I see it reported on. But first. Do you agree with that? Do you worry that
half of all entry level white collar
jobs can be replaced in the next couple of years? I believe that
this technology is going to make its way into
the broad knowledge economy, and it will touch the
majority of entry level jobs. Whether those jobs actually
change is a much more subtle question, and it’s not
obvious from the data. Like we maybe see the hints of
a slowdown in graduate hiring. Maybe if you look at some of
the data coming out right now, we maybe see the signatures
of a productivity boom. But it’s very, very early and
it’s hard to be definitive. But we do know that all
of these jobs will change. All of the entry level jobs
are eventually going to change because A.I. has made
certain things possible, and it’s going to change the
hiring plans of companies. So as a cohort, you might
see fewer job openings for entry level jobs. That would be one
naive expectation out of all of this. But let’s talk about that. Maybe not even being
a naive expectation. You say it’s already happening
at Anthropic that what you’re I’m seeing us shift. Our preference. Exactly and my guess is that
would be happening elsewhere. And where we are right
now, I mean, even in the way I use some of these
systems, it is rare, I think, that Claude or
ChatGPT or Gemini or any of the other systems
is better than the best person in a field. It has not typically
breached that. And there’s all kinds
of things they can’t do. But are they better than
your median college graduate? At a lot of things
Yeah they are. And in a world where you need
fewer of your median college graduates, one thing I’ve
seen people arguing about is whether these systems at
this point can do better than average or replacement
level work. But I always
really worry when I see that because
once we have accepted they can do average
replacement level work. Well, by definition,
most of the work done and most of the people doing
it is average is average. The best people
are the exceptions. And also the way
people become better is that they have
jobs where they learn. When I mean, I have
spent a lot of time hiring young journalists
over my career. And when you hire people out
of college, to some degree, you’re hiring them for their
possible articles and work at that exact moment. But to some degree, you’re
making an investment in them that you think will only pay
off over time as they get better and better and better. And so this world where you
have a potential real impact on entry level jobs and that
world does not feel far away to me, seems to me to have
really profound questions it is raising about the
upskilling of the population, how you end up with people
for senior level jobs down the road, what people aren’t
learning along the way. And one thing we
see is that there is a certain type
of young person that has just lived and
breathed A.I. for several years now. We hire them,
they’re excellent, and they think in entirely
new ways about basically how to get Claude to
work for them. It’s like kids who grew
up on the internet, they were naturally versed
in a way that many people in the organizations they
were coming into weren’t. So figuring out how to teach
that basic experimental mindset and curiosity
about these systems and to encourage it is going
to be really important. People that spend
a lot of time playing around with this stuff
will develop very valuable intuitions, and they will
come into organizations and be able to be extremely
productive at the same time. We’re going to have to figure
out what artisanal skills we want to almost develop maybe
a guild style philosophy of maintaining human
excellence in, and how organizations choose how
to teach those skills. O.K, then what about all those
people in the middle of that? Things move slowly
in the real economy outside Silicon Valley. I think that we often look at
software engineering and think that this is a proxy for how
the rest of the economy works, but it’s often not. It’s often a disanalogy. Organizations will move people
around to where the A.I. systems don’t yet work. And I think that
you won’t see vast, immediate changes in the
makeup of employment, but you will see significant
changes in the types of work people are being asked to do,
and the organizations which are best at of moving their
people around are going to be extremely effective. And ones that
may end up having to make really, really hard
decisions involving laying off workers. The difference
with this A.I. stuff is it maybe happens
a lot faster than previous
technologies, and I think many of the anxieties
people might have about this. Including at
Anthropic, is the speed of this going to make
all of this different. Does it introduce. shear points that we
haven’t encountered before. If you had to bet three
years from now, is the. Unemployment rate for
college graduates. Is it the same as it is now? Is it higher or is it lower? I would guess it is
higher, but not by much. And what I mean by that is
there will be some disciplines today which actually A.I. has
come in and completely changed and completely changed the
structure of that employment market, maybe in a way that’s
adverse to people that have that specialism. But mostly, I think
three years from now, I will have driven a
pretty tremendous growth in the entire economy. And so you’re going to see
lots of new types of jobs that show up as a consequence of
this that we can’t yet can’t yet predict. And you will see graduates
kind of flood into that, I expect. Do you, I know you
can’t predict those new jobs. But if you had to guess what
some of them might look like. I mean, one thing is
just the phenomenon of micro entrepreneur. I mean, there are lots and
lots of ways that you can start businesses online now,
which are just made massively easier by having the A.I.
systems do it for you, and you don’t need to hire a
whole load of people to help you do the huge amounts of
schlep work that involves getting a business
off the ground. It’s more a case of if you’re
a person with a clear idea and a clear vision of
something to do a business in, it’s now the best time
ever to start a business, and you can get up and running
for pennies on the dollar. I expect we’ll see tons and
tons and tons of stuff that has that nature to it. I also expect that we’re going
to see the emergence of what you might think of as
the eye to eye economy, where A.I. agents and A.I.
businesses will be doing business with one another. And we’ll have people
that have figured out ways to basically profit off of
that in the forms of strange New organizations like, what
would it look like to have a firm which specializes in
eye to eye legal contracts. Because I bet you there’s a
way that you can figure out creative ways to start
that business today. There’ll be a lot of
stuff of that flavor. So the thing, the
version of this that I both worry
about and think to be the likeliest,
if you told me what was going
to happen, was it Anthropic, was going to
release Claude Plus in a year, and Claude Plus is somehow
a fully formed coworker and it can mimic end
to end the skills of a lot of
different professions up to the C-suite level. And it’s going to
happen all at once, and it’s going to create
tremendous all at once pressure for
businesses to downsize, to remain competitive with
each other... at a policy level, the fact that would be so
disruptive in that Big Bang, everybody stays home
because of COVID style way. It worries me less because
when things are emergencies, we respond. We actually do policy. But if you told me that
what’s going to happen is that the unemployment rate for
marketing graduates is going to go up by 175%, 300%
to still not be that high. The overall unemployment rate
during the Great Recession topped out in the nine
ish percentile range. So you can have a
lot of disruption without having 50% of
people thrown out of work. If you have 10%, 15%
I mean, that’s very, very, very high, but
it’s not so high. And if it’s only happening
in a couple of industries at a time and it’s grads,
not everybody in the industry being thrown out of work. Well, maybe it’s just that
you’re not good enough. Yeah, right. The superstar is really good. Graduates are
still getting jobs. You should have worked harder. You should have gone
to a better school. And one of my worries is that
we don’t respond to that kind of job displacement. Well, right. Which is a kind of job
displacement we got from China, which is the kind of
job displacement that seems likelier because it’s uneven
and it’s happening at a rate where we can still blame
people for their own fortunes. I’m curious how you
think about that story. I think the default
outcome is something like what you
describe, but getting there is actually a choice. And we can make
different choices. The whole purpose
of what we release in the form of
Anthropic Economic Index is the ability
to have data that ties to occupations that tie
to real jobs in the economy. We do that very intentionally
because it is building a map over time of
how this A.I. is making its way into different
jobs and will empower economists outside
Anthropic to tie it together. I believe that we can choose
different things in policy if we can make much more
well-evidenced claims about what the cause of a
job disruption or change is. And the challenge
in front of us is, can we characterize
this emerging A.I. economy well enough that we can
make this extremely stark. And then I think that
we can actually have a policy discussion about it. Well, let’s talk about
the policy discussion. One reason I wanted to
have you in particular on is you did
policy at OpenAI. You do policy at Anthropic. So you’ve been around these
policy debates for a long time. You’ve been tracking
model capabilities at your newsletter
for a long time. My perception is we are many,
many years into the debate about A.I. and jobs. Many, many years dating
far before ChatGPT, of there being conferences at
Aspen and everywhere else about what are we going
to do about A.I. and jobs. And somehow I still
see almost no policy. That seems to me
to be actionable. If the situation I just
described begins showing up where all of a sudden entry
level jobs are getting much harder to come by across a
large range of industries all at once, such that the economy
cannot reshift all these marketing majors into data
center construction or nurses or something. So, O.K, you’ve been deeper
in this conversation than I’ve been. When you say we can have a
policy conversation about that, we’ve been having
a policy conversation. Do we have policy? We have generalized anxiety
about the effect of A.I. on the economy and on jobs. We don’t have
clear policy ideas. Part of that is that
elected officials are not moved solely or mostly
by the high level policy conversation. There, moved by what happens
to their constituents. Only a few months ago were we
able to produce state level views for our Economic Index. And now you can start having
the policy conversation. And we’ve had this with
elected officials where now we can say, oh, you’re from
you’re from Indiana. Here’s the major uses
of A.I. in your state. And we can join it with
major sources of employment. And what we’re starting to
see is that activates them because it makes it tied to
their constituents who are going to tie it to the
politician of what did you do now. What you do about
this is going to need to be an
extremely kind of multi-layered response,
ranging from extending unemployment for a specialty,
occupations that we know are going to be hardest hit,
to thinking about things like apprenticeship programs. And then as the scenarios get
more and more significant may extend to much larger social
programs or things like subsidizing jobs in the part
of the economy where you want to move people to but you’re
only able to do if you experience the kind of
abundance that comes from significant economic growth. But the economic
growth may help solve some of these other
policy challenges by funding some of
the things you can do. I always find this
answer depressing. I’m going to be honest. Unemployment is a
terrible thing to be on. It’s a program we need. But people on unemployment
are not happy about it. And it’s not a good long
term solution for anybody. Apprentice
retraining programs. They don’t have
great track records. We were not good at
retraining people out of having their
manufacturing jobs outsourced. I’m not saying it is
conceptually impossible that we could get better at it, but
we would need to get better at it fast. And we have not been
putting in the reps or the experimentation or
the institution or capacity building to do that. And the broader question of
big social insurance changes. Doesn’t seem. I mean, that
seems tough to me. I want to push on,
please, just a bit where we know that there
is one intervention that helps people dealing
with a changing economy more than almost
anything else. It is just time giving the
person time to find either a job in their industry
or to find a job that’s complementary. If people don’t have time,
they take lower wage jobs. They fall out of whatever
economic rung they may fall, fall down at. Policy interventions
that can just give people time to search is, I think, a
robustly useful intervention, and one where there
are many like dials to turn in a policy making
sense that you can use. And I think this is just
well supported by lots of economic literature. So we have that now if we end
up in a more extreme scenario some of the ones that
you’re talking about, I think that will just bring
us to the larger national conversation about what to
do about this technology, which is beginning to happen. If you look at the states
and the flurry of legislation at the state level. Yes not all of it is exactly
the right policy response, but it is indicative
of a desire for there to be some larger, coherent
conversation about this. Well, I think time
is a really good way of describing what
the question is, because I agree with you. I mean, when I say
unemployment insurance isn’t a great program to be on, I
don’t mean people don’t need to be on it. I mean, they want
to get off of it. Absolutely because people for
they want money from jobs. They want dignity. They want to be around
other human beings. Usually what you’re doing when
you are helping people buy time is you’re helping them
wait out a time delimited disruption. Not always right. The China shock wasn’t
exactly like that, but that you expect to pass. And then the market is normal. In this case. What you have is a technology
that if what you want to have happen happens,
it is the technology is accelerating. So what you have is like
three different speeds happening here. You have the speed at which
individual people can adjust. How fast can I
learn new skills, figure out a new world, learn
A.I., whatever it might be. You have the speed at
which the A.I. systems, which a couple of years ago
were not capable of doing the work of a median college
grad from a good school, and you have the
speed of policy and the speed at which
the A.I. systems are getting better and able to
do more things is quite fast. I mean, that is you experience
this more than I do, but I find it hard
to even cover this because within three
months something else will have come out that is
significantly changed. What is possible. I had a baby recently and
came back from paternity leave to the new systems we
built was deeply surprised. Individual humans are moving
more slowly than that. And policy and
government institutions move a lot more slowly than
individual human beings. And so typically the
intervention is that time favors the worker,
as you’re saying. And here it will
help the worker. But I think the scary question
is whether time just actually creates time for the
disruption to get worse. Maybe you wanted to move over
to data center construction, but actually now we don’t need
as much data center construct. You can think of it like that. I mean, under the situation
you’re describing, the economy will be
running extremely hot. Huge amounts of
economic activity will be generated
by these A.I. systems. And under most scenarios
where this is happening, I don’t think you’re going to
be seeing GDP stay the same or shrink. It’s going to be getting
substantially larger. I think we just haven’t
experienced major GDP growth in the west in a long time,
and we forget what that affords you in a
policymaking sense. I think that there
are huge projects that we could do that
would allow you to create new types of jobs, but it
requires the economic growth to be so kind of
profoundly large that it creates space
to do those projects. And as you’re deeply
familiar with your work on the abundance movement
it requires for social will to believe that we can build
stuff and to want to build stuff. But I think both of those
things might come along. I think that we
could end up being in a pretty exciting
scenario where we get to choose
how to allocate great efforts in society
due to this large amount of economic growth
that has happened, that is going to
require the conversation to be forced about. This isn’t temporary, which I
think is what you’re gesturing at. And in a sense, the hardest
thing to communicate to policymakers is there
isn’t a natural stopping point for this technology. It’s going to keep
getting better. And the changes it brings
are going to keep compounding with the rest of society. So that will need to create
a change in political will and a willingness to entertain
things which we haven’t in some time. So now I want to flip it. The question I’m asking
you brought up abundance. One of the things I have
learned doing that work is that it is certainly not
my view that what is scarce in society is ideas for
better ways of doing things, that our policy isn’t better
than it is because our policy cupboard is dry. That’s not true. We have lots of good policies. I could name a bunch of them. They’re very hard to get
through our political systems, as they’re currently
constituted the least inspiring version of the A.I. Future is world where
what you have done is create a way to throw
young white collar workers out of work and replace them
with an average level A.I. intelligence. The more exciting version,
to use Dario’s metaphor, is geniuses in a data center. And I do think
that’s exciting. And I wonder when I hear
him or you talk about, well, what if we had 10 percentage
point GDP growth year on year, 20 percentage point GDP
growth year on year. I wonder how many
of our problems are really bounded
at the ideas level. We could go to Nobel
Prize winners right now and say, what should
we do in this country? And a lot of them
could give us some good ideas that we
are not currently doing. I do worry sometimes,
or I wonder, given my experience
on other issues, whether we have overstated to
ourselves, how much of what stands between us
and the expanding. Abundant economy we want is
that we don’t have enough intelligence. And the idea is
that intelligence could create versus
our actual ability to implement things
is very weakened. And what A.I. is going to create
is larger bottlenecks around that, because there’ll be more
being pushed at the system to implement, including dumb
ideas and disinformation and slot right. Like it’ll have things on
the other side of the ledger to how do you think about
these rate limiters? There’s kind of a funny lesson
here from the A.I. companies or companies in general,
especially tech companies, where often new ideas come out
of companies by them creating what they always call the
startups within a startup, which is basically taking
whatever process has built up over time, leading to back
end bureaucracy or schlep work and saying to a very small
team inside the company, you don’t have any of this. Go and do some stuff. And this is how things like
Claude code and other stuff get created. Ideas that kind of are
starting to float around are what would it
look like to create that permissionless innovation
structure in the larger economy. And it’s really, really hard
because it has the additional property that economies
are linked to democracies. Democracies waive
the preferences of many, many people. And all politics is local. So often as you’ve encountered
with infrastructure build outs, if you want to create
a permissionless innovation system, you run into things
like property rights and what people’s preferences are, and
now you’re in an intractable, intractable place. But my sense is that’s the
main thing that we’re going to have to confront. And the one advantage
that I might give us it is kind of a native
bureaucracy eating machine, if done
correctly, or a bureaucracy creating machine. Did you see did you see that
somebody had created a system that basically you feed it
in the documents of a new development near you. Oh, and it writes
environmental review things, or it writes incredibly
sophisticated challenges across every level of the
code that you could possibly challenge on. So most people don’t have the
money when they want to stop an apartment building from
going up down the block to hire a very sophisticated
law firm to figure out how to stop that
apartment building. But basically, this
created that at scale. And so, as you say,
right, it could eat bureaucracy could also
supercharge bureaucracy. Yep it’s for everything
in A.I. has the other side of the coin. We have customers that
have used our A.I. systems to massively reduce the time
it takes them to produce all of the materials they need
when they’re submitting new drug candidates. And it’s cut that
time massively. It’s the mirror-world version
of what you just described. I don’t have an easy,
easy answer to this. I think that this is the
kind of thing that becomes actionable when it is
more obviously a crisis, and actionable when it’s
something that you can discuss at a societal level. I guess the thing that we’re
circling around in this conversation is that the
changes of A.I. will happen almost everywhere,
and the risks of it. It happens in a diffuse,
unknowable way such that it is very hard to
call it for what it is and take actions on it. But the opportunity is that if
we can actually see the thing and help the world
see the thing that is causing this
change, I do believe it will dramatize the
issues to shake us out of some of this stuff
and help us figure out how to work with these
systems and benefit from them. What I notice in all
this is that there is, as far as I can tell,
zero agenda for public A.I.. What does society
want from A.I.? What does it want this
technology to be able to do? What are things
that maybe you would have to create a business
model, or a prize model, or some kind of government
payout, or some kind of policy to shape a market or to
shape a system of incentives. So we have systems that are
solving not just problems at the private market, knows
how to pay for, but problems that it’s nobody’s job but
the public and the government to figure out how to solve. I think I would have bet,
given how much discussion there’s been of A.I. over the
past couple of years and how strong some of these
systems have gotten, that I would have seen more
proposals for that by now. And I’ve talked to people
about it and wondered about it. But I guess I’m curious on
how you think about this. What would it look like
to have at least parallel to all the private incentives
for A.I. development? An actual agenda for
not what we are scared I will do to the public. We need an agenda
for that too. But what we want it to do,
such that companies like yours have reasons to invest
in that direction. I mean, I love this question. I think there’s a real chicken
and egg problem here where if you work with
the technology, you develop these very strong
intuitions for just how much it can do. And the private market
is great at forcing those intuitions
to get developed. We haven’t had massive, large
scale public side deployments of this technology. So many of the people in the
public sector don’t yet have those intuitions. One one positive
example is something the Department of
Energy is doing called the Genesis Project,
where their scientists are working with all of the
labs, including Anthropic, to figure out how to actually
go and intentionally speed up bits of science. Getting there took
US and other labs doing multiple hack days
and meetings with scientists at the Department of
Energy to the point where they not only had intuitions,
but they became excited and they had ideas of what
you could turn this toward, how we do that for the larger
parts of the public life that touch most people
health or education, is going to be a
combination of grassroots efforts from companies
going into those communities and meeting with them. But at some point, we’ll have
to translate it to policy. And I think maybe that’s me
and you and others making the case that this is
something that can be done. And I often say this
to elected officials give us a goal like
the A.I. industry is excellent at trying
to climb to the top on benchmarks, come up with
benchmarks for the public good that you want. So let’s imagine that you
did do something like this. I’ve always been a big fan of
prizes for public development. So let’s say that there
was legislation passed and the Department of Health
and Human services or the NIH or someone came out and said,
here’s 15 problems we would like to see solved that
we think I could be potent at solving. If there was real money there,
if there was, 10, 15 billion behind a bunch of these
problems because they were worth that much
to society, would it materially change the
development priorities at places like Anthropic. I mean, if the
money was there, would it alter the
R&amp;D you all are doing. I don’t think so. Why? Because it’s not
really the money that is the impediment to this stuff. It is the implementation path. It is actually
having a sense of how you get the thing to flow
through to the benefit. And many aspects of
the public sector have not been built to be
super hospitable to technology in general, to incentivize it. I think it mostly
just takes a bounty in the form of
guaranteed impact and guaranteed path
to implementation. Because the main thing
that is scarce at AI organizations is just
the time of the people at the organization,
because you can go in almost any direction. This technology is
expanding super quickly. Many new use cases
are opening up, and you’re just asking
yourself a question of where can we actually
have a positive, meaningful impact
in the world. Super easy to do that
in the private sector because it has all
of the incentives to push stuff through
in the public sector. We more need to solve
this problem of deployment than anything else. What would excite you if
it was announced? What what do you think would
be good candidates for that kind of project? Anything that helps speed
up the time it takes to both speak to medical
professionals and take work off their plate. We had another baby recently. I spend a lot of time on the
Kaiser Permanente advice line because the baby’s bonked its
head or its skin’s a different color today. Or all of these things. And I use Claude to stop me
and my wife panicking while we’re waiting to
talk to the nurse. But then I listened to the
nurse do all of this triaging, ask all of these questions. So obviously, a huge chunk of
this is stuff that you could use A.I. systems productively
for, and it would help the people that we don’t have
enough of spend their time more effectively, and it would
be able to give reassurance to the people going
through the system. And that’s maybe less
inspiring and glamorous than maybe some of what
you’re imagining. But I think mostly when people
interact with public services, their main frustration is just
that it’s opaque and it takes you a long time to
speak to a person. But actually, these are
exactly the kinds of things that I could
meaningfully work on. It’s interesting because what
you’re describing there is less A.I. as a country of
geniuses in a data center, and more A.I. as standard
plumbing of communications and documentation. We’ve got a country of junior
employees in the data center. Let’s do something with that. One thing we haven’t talked
about in this conversation, and it’s just worth bearing
in mind is like the frontier of science is open for
business now in a way that it hasn’t been before. And what I mean by that is
we’ve found a way to build systems that can provably
accelerate human scientists. Human scientists
are extremely rare. They come out at the
end of PhD programs, which never have
enough people, and they work on extremely
important problems. I think we can get into a
world where the government says let’s understand the
workings of a human cell. Let’s team up with the
best A.I. systems to do that. Let’s actually have a better
story on how we deal with some issues like Alzheimer’s
and other things, partly through the use
of these huge amounts of computation that have
been developed and even more aggressively, you could
imagine a world where the government wanted some of
this infrastructure build out to be for computers
that were just training. Public benefit systems. But I think we get there
through getting the initial wins, which will just
look like let’s just make the bureaucracy work better
and feel better for people. I mean, that last
set of ideas was more what I was thinking of. I think that if you’re going
to have a healthy politics around A.I., and A.I. does
pose real risks to people, and real things are going
to go wrong for people. Everything from job loss
to child exploitation to scams, which are
already everywhere to cybersecurity
risks help people see the actual big ticket,
not just to help people see those things have to
actually exist Yeah right. They have to exist. And if all the energy
in A.I. is trying to beat each other to
helping companies downsize their junior
employees, I think people are going
to have good reason to not trust that technology. And it doesn’t mean you
shouldn’t have things that make the economy
more efficient. That’s been we have
automated manufacturing. We have automated, huge
amount of farming, right. And that allows us
to make more things and feed more people. I’m aware of how productivity
improvements work, but we’re very focused, I
think, on what could go wrong. And that’s reasonable. But I really do worry that
our attention to what could go right has been quite poor. There’s kind of hand-waving
that this could help us solve problems in energy
and medicine. And so on. But these are hard problems. They need money. They need compute. If barely any of the compute
is going to Alzheimer’s research, then the systems
are not going to do that much for Alzheimer’s research. And I’m not saying
this is not your fault, but the absence of a public
agenda for A.I. that does not appear to be accelerating the
automation of white collar work. It seems just a little
bit lacking given how big the technology is Yeah the
greatest example is this program called the
Genesis project, where there’s real work there
to think about how we can intentionally move forward
different parts of science. And I think giving elected
officials the ability to stand up to the
American people and say, these are parts
of science that are going to benefit
you in health. And we now know how to
step on the gas with A.I. for them would be
really helpful. My guess is in a
year or two years, we’ll be able to answer
the mail on that one. But it’s just got started. But we need clearly
10 projects like it. So the other side of
this is that the one area of government that I do think
thinks about A.I. in this way is defense. I want to talk about that
broadly, but specifically, Anthropic is in a current
dispute with the Department of Defense or I guess we call
it now, the Department of War over whether it can
continue to be used in it. Because whether or not you’re. Can you describe what
is happening there? I can’t talk about discussions
with an extremely important partner that are ongoing. So I’ll just have
to stop it there. So well I will describe
that there is some dispute, I guess my question, because
I recognize you’re not going to talk about what’s going
on with you and your partner, but it’s about a
broader issue here, which is there is going to be
a lot of offensive possibility in advanced A.I. systems, and
one of the strongest drivers of the speed at which we’re
going with A.I. is competition with China. Some of the biggest
risks that we think about in the near term
are cybersecurity or biological warfare,
are all kinds of ways that others could use these
against us, our drone swarms. And there’s going to be a lot
of money in this and a lot of players in it, and it
really seems unclear to me how you keep this kind of
competition from spinning into something very dangerous. So without talking about
what you may or may not do with the Defense
Department, how has Anthropic thought about
this question more broadly? We’ve been long term partners
to the national security community, and we were the
first to deploy on classified networks. But the reason for
that was actually a project which I
stewarded, which was to figure out if
our A.I. systems knew how to build nuclear weapons. This is an area of bipartisan
agreement where people agree that we shouldn’t deploy AI
systems into the world that know how to build nukes. And so we partnered with
parts of the government to do that analysis that
maybe illustrates what I think of as for a thing to
shoot for not just us, but all the A.I.
companies is how do we both prevent
the potential for national security
harm coming to the public or proliferating out
of these systems? But also the second
part is, how do we just improve the defensive
posture of the world? And I’ll give you an example
that I think is in front of us right now. We recently published a
blog, and other companies have done similar
work on how we fixed a load of
cybersecurity vulnerabilities and popular open source
software using our systems, and many others
have done the same. So yes, there will be all
kinds of offensive uses and there will be
societal conversations to be had about that. But we can just generally
improve the defensive posture and resilience of pretty
much every digital system on the planet today. And I think that will
actually do a huge amount to make the whole
international system more stable and also create a
greater defensive posture for countries, which helps
them feel more relaxed and relaxed. Countries are
less likely to do erratic, frightening
things. That would be good if it happened. My worry is, as an individual
that I feel the opposite might be happening. So I’ve just watched people
installing all kinds of fly by night A.I. software and
giving it a lot of access to their computers without
any knowledge of what the vulnerabilities are. Yep. I myself am nervous about
using things like Claude Code because I am bad at
talking to Claude Code, and I don’t understand
these questions, and I’m worried about loading
onto my computer or something that is creating security
vulnerabilities I don’t even understand. The number of just scam voice
messages I get every day. Everything that are clearly
somewhat A.I. generated, or many of them seem
to me, is very high. There’s a question
of societally, do we use it to
upgrade our systems? I’m actually curious for
your thoughts individually, because as we’re all
experimenting with something we don’t understand and giving
it access to the terminal level of our computers without
any real knowledge of how to use that, it seems like
we might be opening up a lot of vulnerability all at once. It’s the early days of the
internet all over again, where there are all kinds
of banners for different websites, or you could
download like MP3s to your computer that would
completely break your computer or download like helper
software for your Internet Explorer taskbar. That was just like
a phishing device. We’re there. We’re there with A.I. We’ll move beyond this,
but I believe that people, when they experiment, come
up with amazing, amazing, useful things as well. So my take is you have to say,
when you’re doing the thing that might be extremely
dangerous and put big banners, but mostly you still want
to empower people to be able to do that experiment. So when you look
forward, not five years, because I think that’s hard
to do, but one year, yeah, we’ve kind of pushed
into agents fairly fast. We push into code. I think a lot of people think
code might be different than other things, because it’s a
more contained environment, and it’s easier to see what
you’re doing has worked. But from your perspective
of being inside one of these companies and also running
a newsletter where you obsessively track the
developments of a million A.I. systems I’ve never heard
of week on, week on week. What do you see coming now? Like what feels to you like
it is clearly on the horizon, but we’re not quite prepared
for it or won’t feel until it’s arrived. No one has. Maybe the way I’d put it is
sometimes and you’ve likely had the same had the ability
to have certain insights that have come through
of reading a vast, vast amount of stuff from many
different subjects and piecing it together in my head
and having that experience of having a new idea
and being creative. I think we underestimate
just how quickly A.I. is going to be able to
start doing that on an almost daily basis. For us, going and reading vast
tracts of human knowledge, synthesizing things,
coming up with ideas, telling us things about
the world in real time that are basically
unknowable today. But the amazing
part is, people are going to have the
ability to know things that are just wildly expensive
or difficult to know today, or would take you a
team of people to do. But the frightening part is,
I think that knowledge is the most raw form of power. It’s intensely destabilizing
to be in an environment where suddenly everyone is
like a mini CIA in terms of their ability to gather
information about the world. They’ll do huge,
amazing things with it. But surely there are
going to be like crises that come about from this. And I think for the
actual mental load of being a person interacting
with these systems is going to be quite strange. I already find this
where I’m like, am I. Am I keeping up with the
ability of these systems to produce insights for me? Like, how do I
structure my life so I can take advantage of it? I’m very curious about how you
think even having that ongoing conversation with the
systems changes you. So let me I’ll say it
from my perspective. One thing I have noticed
is that the Claude is very, very, very smart. It is smarter than
most people who know about a thing
in any given thing. That is my experience of it. But it is not in the
way that other people are an independent
entity that is rooted in its own concerns and
intuitions and differences. What it is instead
is a computer system trying to adapt itself
to what it thinks I want. So as I’ve talked to it much
more about issues in my life, about issues in my work,
various kind of intellectual inquiries or reporting
inquiries where I’m trying to figure out questions
that as of yet, I’m at of early
stage of exploration. What I’ve noticed over time
is that one difference about in talking to it is
always a yes and. Yep it is never a no, but
it’s never a honestly. Are we still
talking about this? It doesn’t create in the way
that talking to my editor does or talking to a friend does
or my partner or anything. It doesn’t create the
possibilities in another human does for kind of 
checking yourself. It’s always pushing
you further, and it’s not necessarily bad. It doesn’t always lead to
psychosis or sycophancy or anything else, but it is. It is very reinforcing
of the I. Yes, and I don’t wonder
about it so much for me, although I actually even
already feel the pressure of it on me. I was like, oh, more good
ideas coming from me, more interesting things
I’ve come up with. But I do wonder about
kids growing up in a world where they always have
systems like this around them. And the degree
to which there is some amount of
my communication with other human beings is now
offloaded into communication with A.I. systems. I noticed that already
being a kind of cage of my own intuitions,
even as it allows me to run further
with them than I maybe could otherwise. But I’m pretty well formed. And you’ve got
young kids, as I do. I’m curious how you think
about what it means, how it will shape our
personalities to be in these constant conversations. This is maybe my
number one worry about all of this is if
you discover yourself in partnership
with the A.I. system, you are uniquely vulnerable to
all of the failures of that A.I. system. And not just failures, but the
personality of the A.I. system will shape if you haven’t. I’m going to sound
very Californian here, even though I’m from England. It soaked its way
into my brain. You have to know yourself. And have done some
work on yourself. I think to be effective
in being able to critique how this A.I. system
gives you advice. And so for my kids, I’m going
to encourage them to just have a daily journaling practice
from an extremely young age, because my bet is
for in the future, there will be two
types of people. There will be people who have
co-created their personality through a back and forth
with an A.I., and some of that will just be weird. They will seem a little
different to regular people, and there will maybe be
problems that creep in because of that. And there will be people who
have worked on understanding themselves outside the
bubble of technology and then bring that as context
in with their interactions. And I think that latter,
that latter type of person will do better. But ensuring that
people do that is actually going to be hard. But don’t you think the way
people are going to discover themselves is with
the technology. I think you were one of the
first people who said to me, I should try keeping a
journal. Yeah in the systems. And I’ve done that on and off
Yeah and one thing it does is it makes it more interesting
to keep a journal, because you have something
reflecting back at you and picking out
themes and so on. But the other
thing it does is it allows, I feel it as a
pull toward self-obsession because I drop in, audio
record a journal entry and I drop it in. And all of a sudden I have
this endlessly interested other system to
tell me about me. And it connects to
something I said. And I know, Ezra you’re going
through an amazing journey here. And I genuinely can’t
tell if it’s a good thing or a bad thing. But I think that the
I mean, we already know from survey
data that a lot of what people are
doing on these systems is adjacent to therapy. And this. But this to me is
I think it changed. It will change how
these systems get built. It will change, I think best
practices that people have with these systems, and I
think that we actually don’t quite understand what this
interaction looks like, but it’s extremely
important to understand it. I mean, just to go back how in
the same way that you can get Claude to ask you questions
to more clearly specify what you’re trying to do, and that
leads to a better outcome. I think we’re going to need to
build ways that these systems can try and elicit from the
person the actual problem they’re trying to solve,
rather than go down a freewheeling path together. Because in some
cases, especially people that are going through
some kind of mental crisis, that is the exact moment
when a friend would say, this is nonsense you were
not making any sense. Take a walk and call me
tomorrow or let’s talk about a different subject. I don’t think you’re reasoning
correctly about this, but A.I. systems will happily
go along with you until they affirmed a belief
that may be wrong. And I think this is
just a design problem, and also will be
a social problem that we have to contend with. And I just wonder how much
it’ll be a social force. I think we’ve given a lot
of attention correctly. So to the places
where it moves into psychosis or strange
human relationships. We’re seeing it through its
most extreme manifestations, and those will become
more widespread. I’m not saying they are
not worth the attention, but for most people, it
is just going to be a kind of a pressure in the same
way that being on Instagram, I think makes
people more vain. In the same way that we
have become more capable of seeing ourselves
in the third person. The mirror is a technology. I mean, I think it’s funny
that the myth of Narcissus, he’s got to look in
a pond Yeah, right. It was actually quite
unusual to see yourself for much of human history. When the mirrors
came out, they were like, oh, this is going
to lead to some issues. There’s a lot of interesting
research on how mirrors have changed us. And as somebody who believes
in the medium as a message thing, A.I. is a medium
and it will change us as we are in
relationship to it. Probably more so
than other things, because it is this
kind of relationship that has a kind of mimicry
of an actual relationship. Yes, I’ve used these AI
systems to basically say, hey, I’m in conflict with
someone at Anthropic. I’m really annoyed. Could you just ask me some
questions about that person and how they’re feeling
to try and help me? I guess better think about the
world from their perspective. And that’s a case where I’m
not using the technology to affirm my beliefs or
show I’m in the right, but actually to help me just
try and sit with how has this other person, other person
experiencing this situation. And it’s been profoundly
helpful for then going and having the hard
conflict conversation, sometimes even saying, well,
I talked to Claude and me and Claude came to the
understanding you might be feeling this way. Do I have that right? And sometimes it’s right, but
sometimes when it’s wrong, it’s really helpful for that
other person to have seen me go through that exercise and
empathy and spending time to try and understand
them without before coming into the conflict. Do you have strong
views on how you want to parent
in a world where AI is becoming more ubiquitous? Yes, I have a classic
Californian technology executive view of not
having that much technology around for children. But I was raised in
that format as well. Like we had a computer
in my dad’s office. My dad would let me
play on the computer, and at some point
he’d like, say, Jack, you’ve had enough
computers today. You’re getting weird. And I’m like, I’m
not getting weird. No, no, you’ve
got to let me in. He was like, see. Being weird. Get out. I think finding a way to
budget your child’s time with technology has always been
the work of parents and will continue to be. I recognize, though, that
it’s getting more ubiquitous and hard to escape. We have a smart TV. My toddler, she can watch
Bluey and a couple of other shows, but we haven’t let
her have unfettered access to the YouTube algorithm. It freaks me out, but I see
her seeing the YouTube pane on the TV, and I know at some
point we’re going to have to have that conversation. So we’re going to need to
build pretty heavy parental controls into this system. We serve eighteens
and up today, but obviously kids are smart
and they’re going to try and get onto this stuff. You’re going to need to build
a whole bunch of systems to prevent children spending
so much time with this. I think that’s a
good place to end. Always our final question
what are three books you’d recommend to the audience? Ursula Le Guin "The
Wizard of Earthsea" was the first book I read. It’s a book where
magic comes from, knowing the true
name of things, and it’s also a meditation
on hubris, in this case, of a person with thinking
they can push magic very far. I read it now as a
technologist, thinking, oh, Eric Hoffer, "The
True Believer," which is a book on the
nature of mass movements and the psychology of
what causes people to have strong beliefs, which I
read because I think that I technologists have
strong beliefs and maybe part of a strong culture
that includes the word cult. And so you need to
understand the science and psychology behind that. And finally, a
book called "There Is No Antimemetics Division"
by a writer with the name qntm, which is about
concepts that are in themselves information
hazards where even thinking about them can be dangerous. And I always recommend it
to people working on A.I. risk as a book adjacent to the
things they worry about. Jack Clark, thank
you very much. Thanks very much, Ezra.
